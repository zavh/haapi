Laravel Backend for Home Automation system.
This backend  provides API for Web, Andorid and iOS front ends which are all made with React Native.

Development notes:
• Send Events to clients (Server Sent Event capabilities)
• JWT Implementation. Instead of Laravel's CSRF, JSON Web Token has been used for Authentication
